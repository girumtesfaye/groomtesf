                <p>Galileo, in full Galileo Galilei, (born February 15, 1564, Pisa [Italy]—died January 8, 1642, Arcetri, near Florence),
                Italian natural philosopher, astronomer, and mathematician who made fundamental contributions to the sciences of motion,
                astronomy, and strength of materials and to the development of the scientific method. His formulation of (circular)
                inertia, the law of falling bodies, and parabolic trajectories marked the beginning of a fundamental change in the study
                of motion. His insistence that the book of nature was written in the language of mathematics changed natural philosophy
                from a verbal, qualitative account to a mathematical one in which experimentation became a recognized method for
                discovering the facts of nature. Finally, his discoveries with the telescope revolutionized astronomy and paved the way
                for the acceptance of the Copernican heliocentric system, but his advocacy of that system eventually resulted in an
                Inquisition process against him.</p> <br>
                <h2>Early Life And Career</h2>  <br><br> <p> Galileo was born in Pisa, Tuscany, on February 15, 1564, the oldest son of
                Vincenzo Galilei, a musician who made important contributions to the theory and practice of music and who may
                have performed some experiments with Galileo in 1588–89 on the relationship between pitch and the tension of
                strings. The family moved to Florence in the early 1570s, where the Galilei family had lived for generations. In
                his middle teens Galileo attended the monastery school at Vallombrosa, near Florence, and then in 1581
                matriculated at the University of Pisa, where he was to study medicine. However, he became enamoured with
                mathematics and decided to make the mathematical subjects and philosophy his profession, against the protests of
                his father. Galileo then began to prepare himself to teach Aristotelian philosophy and mathematics, and several
                of his lectures have survived. In 1585 Galileo left the university without having obtained a degree, and for
                several years he gave private lessons in the mathematical subjects in Florence and Siena. During this period he
                designed a new form of hydrostatic balance for weighing small quantities and wrote a short treatise, La
                bilancetta (“The Little Balance”), that circulated in manuscript form. He also began his studies on motion,
                which he pursued steadily for the next two decades. <br><br> In 1588 Galileo applied for the chair
                of mathematics at the University of Bologna but was unsuccessful. His reputation was, however, increasing, and
                later that year he was asked to deliver two lectures to the Florentine Academy, a prestigious literary group, on
                the arrangement of the world in Dante’s Inferno. He also found some ingenious theorems on centres of gravity
                (again, circulated in manuscript) that brought him recognition among mathematicians and the patronage of
                Guidobaldo del Monte (1545–1607), a nobleman and author of several important works on mechanics. As a result, he
                obtained the chair of mathematics at the University of Pisa in 1589. There, according to his first biographer,
                Vincenzo Viviani (1622–1703), Galileo demonstrated, by dropping bodies of different weights from the top of the
                famous Leaning Tower, that the speed of fall of a heavy object is not proportional to its weight, as Aristotle
                had claimed. The manuscript tract De motu (On Motion), finished during this period, shows that Galileo was
                abandoning Aristotelian notions about motion and was instead taking an Archimedean approach to the problem. But
                his attacks on Aristotle made him unpopular with his colleagues, and in 1592 his contract was not renewed. His
                patrons, however, secured him the chair of mathematics at the University of Padua, where he taught from 1592
                until 1610. <br><br> Although Galileo’s salary was considerably higher there, his responsibilities
                as the head of the family (his father had died in 1591) meant that he was chronically pressed for money. His
                university salary could not cover all his expenses, and he therefore took in well-to-do boarding students whom
                he tutored privately in such subjects as fortification. He also sold a proportional compass, or sector, of his
                own devising, made by an artisan whom he employed in his house. Perhaps because of these financial problems, he
                did not marry, but he did have an arrangement with a Venetian woman, Marina Gamba, who bore him two daughters
                and a son. In the midst of his busy life he continued his research on motion, and by 1609 he had determined that
                the distance fallen by a body is proportional to the square of the elapsed time (the law of falling bodies) and
                that the trajectory of a projectile is a parabola, both conclusions that contradicted Aristotelian physics.</p>
