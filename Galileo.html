                <p>
                    ". . . at the same time, Galileo turned his “optical tube” to the sky and invented the telescope. She was growing 30 times. He
                    improved the definition of the movement of bodies in space, developing the concept of inertia. This notion allowed him
                    to explain the movement of a mass in the field of gravity. Though a follower of Aristotle’s natural philosophy, he
                    considered that bodies were not naturally at rest. In his eyes, rest was not the end of the movement. The bodies were at
                    rest only in relation to other animated bodies of the same speed."

                    "But Galileo could not explain the fundamental reason for the movement of bodies and the relative displacement of
                    objects. He explained the changes in positions as the result of an “efficient” cause, an idea faithful to the school of
                    Aristotle. By observing the phases of Venus and the other planets Galileo managed to confirm the heliocentric system of
                    Copernicus. He discovered the sunspots, the satellites of Jupiter, the relief of the Moon and the fact that the Milky
                    Way consisted of myriads of stars. But as everyone knows, his discoveries were against the doctrine of the Church and
                    led Galileo before the Inquisition …" <br><br> "In his Paradise Lost, John Milton who lived in Galileo’s day,
                    translated the impression that every observer feels when he observes the sky for the first time through a telescope:
                    “Before their eyes suddenly appear the secrets from the old Abyss, a dark, boundless, dimensionless ocean, where length,
                    breadth and depth, time and space are lost. ” The effect that Galileo’s telescope has on his contemporaries is a
                    wonderful reflection of the sensations we experience in our turn, when this reality is separated from its subject by a
                    temporal chasm of more than three centuries."
                </p>
                <p>
                    The basic tool that Galileo used was a crude refracting telescope. His initial version only magnified 8x but was soon
                    refined to the 20x magnification he used for his observations for Sidereus nuncius. It had a convex objective lens and a
                    concave eyepiece in a long tube. The main problem with his telescopes was their very narrow field of view, typically
                    about half the width of the Moon.
