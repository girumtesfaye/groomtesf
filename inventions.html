                <h2>Galileo-Galilei's Discoveries</h2>
                <p> In the spring of 1609 he heard that in the Netherlands an instrument had been invented that showed distant things as
                    though they were nearby. By trial and error, he
                    quickly figured out the secret of the invention and made his own three-powered spyglass from lenses for sale in
                    spectacle makers’ shops. Others had done the same; what set Galileo apart was that he quickly figured out how to
                    improve the instrument, taught himself the art of lens grinding, and produced increasingly powerful telescopes. In
                    August of that year he presented an eight-powered instrument to the Venetian Senate (Padua was in the Venetian
                    Republic). He was rewarded with life tenure and a doubling of his salary. Galileo was now one of the highest-paid
                    professors at the university. In the fall of 1609 Galileo began observing the heavens with instruments that
                    magnified up to 20 times. In December he drew the Moon’s phases as seen through the telescope, showing that the
                    Moon’s surface is not smooth, as had been thought, but is rough and uneven. In January 1610 he discovered four moons
                    revolving around Jupiter. He also found that the telescope showed many more stars than are visible with the naked
                    eye. These discoveries were earthshaking, and Galileo quickly produced a little book, Sidereus Nuncius (The Sidereal
                    Messenger), in which he described them. He dedicated the book to Cosimo II de Medici (1590–1621), the grand duke of
                    his native Tuscany, whom he had tutored in mathematics for several summers, and he named the moons of Jupiter after
                    the Medici family: the Sidera Medicea, or “Medicean Stars.” Galileo was rewarded with an appointment as
                    mathematician and philosopher of the grand duke of Tuscany, and in the fall of 1610 he returned in triumph to his
                    native land. <br></p>

                    <br> <p> Galileo was now a courtier and lived the life of a gentleman. Before he left Padua
                    he had discovered the puzzling appearance of Saturn, later to be shown as caused by a ring surrounding it, and in
                    Florence he discovered that Venus goes through phases just as the Moon does. Although these discoveries did not
                    prove that Earth is a planet orbiting the Sun, they undermined Aristotelian cosmology: the absolute difference
                    between the corrupt earthly region and the perfect and unchanging heavens was proved wrong by the mountainous
                    surface of the Moon, the moons of Jupiter showed that there had to be more than one centre of motion in the
                    universe, and the phases of Venus showed that it (and, by implication, Mercury) revolves around the Sun. As a
                    result, Galileo was confirmed in his belief, which he had probably held for decades but which had not been central
                    to his studies, that the Sun is the centre of the universe and that Earth is a planet, as Copernicus had argued.
                    Galileo’s conversion to Copernicanism would be a key turning point in the Scientific
                    Revolution.<br><br> After a brief controversy about floating bodies, Galileo again turned his attention
                    to the heavens and entered a debate with Christoph Scheiner (1573–1650), a German Jesuit and professor of
                    mathematics at Ingolstadt, about the nature of sunspots (of which Galileo was an independent discoverer). This
                    controversy resulted in Galileo’s Istoria e dimostrazioni intorno alle macchie solari e loro accidenti (“History and
                    Demonstrations Concerning Sunspots and Their Properties,” or “Letters on Sunspots”), which appeared in 1613. Against
                    Scheiner, who, in an effort to save the perfection of the Sun, argued that sunspots are satellites of the Sun,
                    Galileo argued that the spots are on or near the Sun’s surface, and he bolstered his argument with a series of
                    detailed engravings of his observations.</p>
